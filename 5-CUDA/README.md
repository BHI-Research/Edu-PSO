# Edu-PSO CUDA
A simple parallel implementation of PSO optimized with CUDA written in C++

### How to run
By just running the `run.sh` script you will compile and execute this PSO implementation. Make sure to have `cmake` installed first.
The generated binary files will be located at `/build`.

```
